Timo Keurentjes
A software developer who's eager to learn and help


+ About
I started learning to code in 2013. Apart from learning to code, I learned that I enjoy helping others find a solution to their problems. I first started actively doing this as a forum moderator for [Anchor CMS]. I continued doing this in chat rooms and ended up finding an open source project to contribute to. I've been a Core Team member at freeCodeCamp since October 2016. I'm currently a software development intern at [LeanForms].


+ Projects

++ freeCodeCamp Guide
The freeCodeCamp Guide is a reference for all things related to programming, oriented at beginners.
As one of the main contributors to this project, I work on the React-based platform and help make contributing content as easy as possible.

++ Dummi
Dummi generates randomised data to help designers create designs that can handle real data that has names longer than "John Doe."
I built this tool with [Aaron Benjamin] (designer at Amazon) and [Marc Mueller] (developer from Berlin) in August 2016.
